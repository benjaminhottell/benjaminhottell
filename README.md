Hi, my name is Benjamin (you can also call me Ben)

I recently graduated from Appalachian State University _summa cum laude_ with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy.

I have experience working with these languages:

- Python
- Java
- C++
- C (specifically C89/C90)

I am also interested in learning Rust.
